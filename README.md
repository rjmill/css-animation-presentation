# CSS Animation Presentation

These are the notes and examples that I used for my presentation on CSS
animations. Slides can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vof5j7it7kZg3rO7noOtVA_FVio4Q6HCbfTdQGnYZUQ/edit?usp=sharing)

The notes were purely for my own benefit, so they're pretty rough. I've included
them anyway in case anyone is interested. The `cheatsheet.md` is still
work-in-progress.
